I wasn't used to wearing compression socks] on my last long-haul flight. Ever since I tried toe socks in elementary school, I could never go back to regular socks. My closet is always stocked with toe socks; when I lived in Singapore, I even made sure to buy socks and sneakers whenever I visited Taiwan.

### Toe Socks
In recent years, whenever I had to wear regular socks, such as "buying a pair last minute because my socks got wet while ice skating" or "wearing non-slip socks for trampolining," my sensitive toe nerves would constantly feel the sweat accumulating in the gaps between the socks and my feet, promoting fungal fermentation. The sensation of a wet, smelly bundle squeezing inside the toe box is unbearable. Especially since the aforementioned sports emphasize balance, wearing toe socks allows for individual control of each toe, significantly increasing grip strength and precision.

Apart from sports, wearing toe socks at home is even more convenient. Aside from being warm and absorbent, my toes remain dexterous enough to pick up items from the floor or hook shoes out of the cabinet without bending over. It's also no problem if I need to step out briefly in flip-flops or sneakers.

Toe socks might also be helpful for rock climbing. I know many people buy their own climbing shoes just to pursue that barefoot feel (not wanting to wear socks inside climbing shoes). I always rent shoes at the gym because I'm too lazy to clean them, and I don't feel that being barefoot makes much of a difference. I recommend toe socks to anyone with sweaty feet or who simply dislikes regular socks. After all, nobody sees them inside your shoes, so you don't have to worry about them looking ugly. As for brands, there are many Taiwanese options. I personally prefer materials that are slightly thick and soft; if too thin, the big toe will poke through; if too hard, they will slip, failing to utilize the advantages of toe socks.

### Habits
Wearing compression socks this time made me realize that my preference for toe socks might stem from my poor movement habits:
- I cannot tolerate slippery socks or floors; they make me feel unstable. I even suspect that my childhood dislike of skirts was actually a dislike of pantyhose.
- I have good bounce, but I appeared clumsy when playing on surfing machines or skateboards by the roadside previously.
- Actual test: I can stand on one foot with my eyes closed very stably and pose however I want; but kneeling on one knee on the edge of a bed with my eyes open, I lose balance and fall within ten seconds; kneeling on both knees on foam mats also hurts because my balance is poor, and I can't precisely control the pressure points.

It turns out this is a sign of weak hip joints, causing me to rely entirely on my ankles. This places a massive burden on my calf muscles, making them thick and developed, and once overloaded, they are prone to sprains.

Perhaps it is precisely because I have long relied on ankle power that I care so much about grip, and thus choose toe socks?
