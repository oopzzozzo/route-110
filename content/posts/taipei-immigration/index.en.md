### Renting
I recently signed a lease for a 3-bedroom, 2-living room, 2-bathroom apartment near my office. Both my family and I are very satisfied with the place, and the rent is reasonable relative to the property. The only issue is that living alone, I can't fully utilize its value, and being far from the MRT station makes it difficult to find roommates.

### Internet
I've been looking forward to getting internet set up for a long time. Once it's installed, I plan to move my NAS and Raspberry Pi there, and purchase an additional desktop computer.

When comparing internet plans, I don't think I need high bandwidth, but I do want a stable 10M/10M speed (so I can stake Ethereum when I have the money). The most stable approach would be to install two different internet services, such as using Kbro Cable as backup with Chunghwa Telecom HiNet. (Assuming the load balancer is more reliable than HiNet)

I looked at several plans, all are "best effort" with no compensation for outages:

| Plan | Speed | Monthly Fee | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- | ----- |
| Chunghwa Telecom HiNet | 500M/500M | 1,299 NTD | Most stable single plan; in contrast, the 1G/1G plan gets throttled to 100M/60M if you exceed limits for three consecutive days |
| Kbro Broadband Short-term Plan | 150M/50M | 699 NTD | Not particularly cheap unless you live in areas with many elderly residents to get discounted rates, though those areas probably have less bandwidth congestion |
| Chunghwa Telecom ADSL | 2M/64K | 228 NTD | Has a fixed IP, but really too slow, only suitable for checking email |
| CNS Metered 25G | 60M/20M | 98 NTD (cap at 699 NTD) | Great backup or low-traffic plan, unfortunately service doesn't extend to the outskirts of Taipei... |

Conclusion:
> Network stability is a non-issue really, I'll worry about it when I actually start making money from hosting websites.

### Furniture
The landlord didn't provide a bed, cabinets, or TV. I need to get things I like myself. After paying first month's rent plus two months' deposit, I realized I still need to spend so much money...

- Standing desk: Because I'm too short, I need a desk that can lower to below 60cm, which costs 50% more than regular 70cm+ desks. Height tax QQ
- Dehumidifier and air purifier: I can go a month or two without them, but logically I should buy them sooner.
- Monitor, desktop PC, surveillance camera, hard drives: Configuring everything can easily cost too much money.
- Water bottle, extension cords, clock, trash can, floor mat...: Inexpensive necessities, no need to skimp, but they add up to quite a bit.
- Graphics card, electronic keyboard, oscilloscope: Toys I've always wanted to buy when I have the space, and the earlier you buy, the earlier you can play.

No wonder last time I visit my friend's new place, she showed off all the cutleries from her parents' house.
