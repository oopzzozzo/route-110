### Reservation
I heard that 北都光世紀, not listed in [previous post]({{<ref "taipei-immigration">}}) is a good deal, though I still trust HiNet's stability more and decided on the 500M/500M plan.

I booked online but the customer service didn't call me that day. I then went to a physical store and booked a setup session two days later. I had this conversation with the teller:
> Me, "Will I be able to cancel the free wifi router addon if I find it not covering my house well?"<br>
Teller, "If you don't want it, I can cancel for you now. After installation you'll have to keep the machine, anyway it's free."<br>
Me, "Though I'll need to pay daily rent for it if I decide to terminate the contract early..."<br>
Teller, "Yeah, nothing would happen unless you terminate the contract..."<br>
Me, "Hmm, let's keep it first since the plan is migratable to other addresses."<br>

### Setup Procedure
The engineer suggests to run the fiber from living to dinning room for better wifi signal in bedroom. I told him I'd prefer having the router outside and run cables into the bedroom, pointing out my desktop still in board box. Then he suggests to run the fiber all the way to the bedroom. I told him I have a NAS machine that I want to put in the living room, and concluded not to care about wifi signal for now, worst case I'll buy my own mesh to solve the problem.

He then asked for my preference in wifi SSID and password. I though he would leave it to me with a default one thus asked, "Isn't this changable?" "Yes, please download CHT wifi App." he answered. "No http interface?" "No, you can find the app from play store."

### After Math
- I should've tell him my use case in the very beginning. It is reasonable for him to guess I only use wifi from my empty house.
- Still ridiculous that the router can only be configured via app.
