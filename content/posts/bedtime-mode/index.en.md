I recently enabled bedtime mode on my Android phone. It turns the display into grayscale. Grayscale makes the phone less attractive as it blocks me from color hue information, which I strongly rely on for sorting icons and categorizing calendar events.

The most surprising part was about my blog. I list a cover image for each post with the hope that it makes things easier to recognize and remember. However, when I browse in grayscale, my eyes automatically skip the cover images. The images only make the titles more scattered.

I realized that people with different color perception would naturally have different preferences for art forms, and I'm not able to predict my favorite form in the future. The only thing I'll be able to do is to build things the way I like at this moment.
