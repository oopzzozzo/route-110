### Balcony
My current abode features dual balconies facing north and south.

I intend to plant bamboo on the front balcony to favor Feng Shui, while the rear is reserved for laundry and herbs.

### Seedlings
Having acquired soil and seeds, I found myself wanting for seedling tools. Thus, I purchased seedlings from the market, reckoning my seeds would sprout by the time these were consumed.

The old vendor recommended Taiwanese lettuce for its ease: fertilize in a week, harvest in a month. Twelve seedlings for twenty-four dollars.

Alas, a week's travel led to neglect. Cold days and short sun brought forth green pests. A month passed, and the harvest was meager—far less than what twenty-four dollars could purchase.

### Technological Aid
To thrive in indoor gardening, I deem the following tools essential. The path of DIY is arduous; I yearn to perfect it at once, lest passion fades into abandonment.

#### Grow Lights
To supplement daylight intensity according to ambient brightness. For I loathe extraneous light in my dwelling more than I rue poor harvests.

#### Automatic Watering
To circulate water from the saucer back to the soil, replenishing from a reserve when depleted.

#### Time-lapse Surveillance
To monitor growth remotely, providing data for AI analysis to refine future developments.
