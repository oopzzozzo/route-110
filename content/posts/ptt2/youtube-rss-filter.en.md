I migrated my tt-rss server from NAS to my old laptop with SSD to improve performance. I later wanted to further migrate it onto a Raspberry Pi so I don't need to keep my laptop powered on.

I bought an SSD for my Raspberry Pi, but it turned out that my Raspberry Pi shows a "low voltage" warning and crashes. As a result, my RSS server is still running on my old laptop.

Recently I find YouTube shorts included in RSS really annoys me. I applied a [reddit solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/14o44dy/comment/lhphi3b/) to check the top and bottom color of video thumbnail and filter them out. However, I ran into an [edge case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3-kpRz-e1Q) by 3b1b in two days.
