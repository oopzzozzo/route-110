I visited NCTU job fair with my high school friend D last month. It was rainy heavily, we took bus and walked through NTHU.

### Stalls
#### AUO and Garmin
I stared at someone holding a sign for AUO, "Subit your resume and get a chance to win Garmin (watch)!". D asked "You wanna submit?" I replied "I was just thinking, if AUO is giving away Garmin, what is Garmin gonna give away?"

Later we found Garmin's big stall, they also give away watches.

#### Satellite and Biotech Companies
I find these two companies staffs socially outward and friendly.

I asked at the satellit stall, "Do you do a lot of maintainence work for your product?" Staff replied "No, we usually just deliver to the user unit (weather, imaging...) for operation." I asked "How long is your product cycle?" He said "If we can reach our goal by combining existing components, we finish in a year."

I asked at the biotech stall, "Does work performance strongly depend on experiment skills and luck?" Staff answered "It is way better than doing research. Academic experiments fail usually because the experiment itself is hard, not because one is not skilled or unlucky. In the industry we work in teams, there are few ways one would suffer alone." This sounds quite interesting to me. The philosophy is so different from software industry where we usually want the work to be done by less people if possible. Staff, "Are you studying in a related area?" I replied "Actually I am not related to Bio at all."

#### South Asians
I saw two south asians chatting in two different stalls. I'm quite curious how it's like to visit career fairs without Chinese. Unfortunately it was too crowded and rainy that I'm not able to follow them around.
