We went to a Korean restaurant today. My brother ordered rice pot, and I ordered tofu soup. My brother finished his food fast, leaned back for a while, then said softly, "I want a piece of tofu". I sensed he meant the piece in the right corner of my bowl, so I picked up my spoon and scooped.

"Half a piece is enough" my brother reacted. I was surprised of my incorrect sense and asked, "Isn't this the piece you wanted?" while handing it to him. He ate the whole piece then answered, "I have been eyeing it for a short time, but I only care about the part floating above the surface."

Thankfully my brother is in his twenties and able to articulate such precise desire. Otherwise, I would never be able to telepathize.
