For the past two weeks, my family members have been busy with their own affairs, and I finally have more time to organize my living space. Doing things LLMs can't help me with.

# Silicone
I've only bought silicone three times in my life.
- When I participated in the Si-Yuan Science and Creativity Competition in high school, I found that anything that leaked when glued with hot melt adhesive could be solved with silicone.
- When I first moved to Singapore, I put a blackboard on the wall in my room, attached a plastic cable tray to serve as a chalk rail, and applied silicone to protect the gaps from chalk dust.
- Yesterday, I DIYed a transparent food waste fermentation barrel, gluing a hydraulic bottle to a plastic barrel and using silicone to prevent air leakage.

I used it more frequently in high school, and each time, I'd feel unwell afterward. In Singapore, I tried to avoid direct skin contact, but ultimately, my bare hands were indispensable, and I again felt unwell the following day. Just yesterday, an attempt to apply it with a syringe failed, leading me to use my hands once more, with the same uncomfortable outcome.

Despite the discomfort, its effectiveness is undeniable. There's no reason to give it up.

# Linseed Oil
As far as I know, I've used it twice:
- In high school art class, mixed with turpentine for oil painting.
- This week, to wipe down the dining table and chair set I bought from IKEA.

The pine table and chair set I bought from IKEA were not varnished, so they felt light and were more absorbent than standard finishes, making me worried about leaving marks. So I bought 500cc of linseed oil from a chemical supply store, and this Saturday, I decided to tackle the task myself.

The process proved more challenging than expected. Initially, I intended to apply a thin layer with a paper towel, but the wood's high absorbency necessitated a change to a BBQ brush, followed by wiping dry. To ensure thorough coverage, I had to invert the chairs onto the table to coat their undersides, avoiding the need to paint while lying on the floor. Even just four chairs consumed a significant amount of time; mass production would surely involve a quick dip in an oil bath.

I'd already used nearly 200cc of oil before even touching the table. While I had envisioned applying several thin coats, it now seems unnecessary.
