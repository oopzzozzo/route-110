### Dreamland
When I was a child, I often dreamed of waking up in the morning, changing clothes, and going to school, only to wake up still in bed. After college, this dream evolved: I would dream that it was time to get up for work in Taipei, and only to realize upon waking that I was at home in Hsinchu.

Recently, this dream evolved even further. A morning in Taipei,
- I dreamed of waking up in Taipei, realized it's a dream.
- Guess that I must be in Hsinchu then, thus dreamed through the morning routine in Hsinchu. Though I felt something was off.
- Then I dreamed that I'm supposed to start work, but wasn't prepare thus can't make it to work. This was quite scary for me.
- I was horrified, lost the sense of reality, dreamed of time jumping to wakeup at home ten years later, and realized that my family members are so old but I achieved nothing after ten years.
- More time and space jumping went on...

After finally waking up. I sat sweating, "What if one day I get trapped in this loop and can never wake up?"
### Comments
I asked my brother if he ever had similar dreams becaused he has lived in many more places then I have. He commented,
> When I wakeup in my dreams, I'd just fly aroud in the room and never think about school nor work!
