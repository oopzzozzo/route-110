Today I joined a warm talk with my family in the neighborhood. Before it started, I scanned around the room

Me, "Everyone is bringing their children."<br>
Bro, "We are the only group bringing our parents."<br>
Bro, "Typical event in Hsinchu."

We walked towards home after the talk. My dad asked what to drink at home. While I wonder where did this question come from, my brother answered water and explained right away, "I agree we should always get bubble tea after talks. But we are just few steps away from home..."
