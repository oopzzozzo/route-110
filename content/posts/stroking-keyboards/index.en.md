Recently, my brother accompanied me to 3C marketplace to for keyboards. Last week, we went to a 3D marketplace again, and I still tapped on every keyboard I saw.

Bro, "Haven't you bought a keyboard already?"<br>
Me, "Cats owners would also stroke stray cats, not to say my keyboard could never be mad at me."

Then, we saw a big keyboard statue in front of a stall.
Bro, "Look! There's a big cat."
