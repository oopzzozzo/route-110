Lately, I often feel a sudden urgency to use the restroom.

There are four stalls in the women's restroom next to my office, and there are fewer than users in that area, so the restroom is often empty. Lately, it feels even emptier. I once wondered if it was because going to the restroom more often led me to a higher chance of observing myself alone in there. After thinking it over, I realized that didn't make sense. If my correlation with others using the restroom hasn't changed, increasing my sample size shouldn't change the sample ratio.

It seems that the "number of people seen in the restroom" is not an estimation of "relative level of 'wage theft'," but an estimation of "level of holding hands to the restroom after a meeting."
