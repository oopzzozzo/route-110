I watched baseball in Taipei Dome this weekend. Fubon Guardians vs. Chinatrust Brothers. I sat in the second floor, third base side. I had a good view of the game, but not the cheerleaders. After the game, there was a close game music performance which took about half an hour to setup the audio and lighting.

Fubon's closer Chang Yi's walk in activity was for the audience to wave their phone flash light. I don't know the story behind, only enjoyed the beautiful view of the starry dome.

There was also a phone light waving part during the music performance. The flash lights tinted yellow. I wonder if it was an impression from the rather blue lighting of the venure, or is it caused by light scattering through the moisture.
